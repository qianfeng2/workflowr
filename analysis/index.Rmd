## Project overview

The purpose of this project is to gain some insight into city-wide
biking trends by analyzing the
[Divvy trip data](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data). Also, I
examine trip data from one bike station at the University of Chicago
to compare the biking patterns at the university against city-wide
trends.

All the results and plots presented in the pages below should be
reproduceable on your computer. Follow the
[Setup Instructions](setup.html) if you are interested in reproducing
the results for yourself.

These are the results of my analyses. They were generated by rendering
the [R Markdown documents](https://github.com/pcarbo/wflow-divvy/tree/master/analysis)
into webpages.

1. [A first glance at the Divvy data.](first-glance.html) 

2. [A map of the Divvy stations in Chicago.](station-map.html)

3. [Exploring daily bike commuting trends from the Divvy
data.](time-of-day-trends.html)

4. [Exploring seasonal biking trends from the Divvy
data.](seasonal-trends.html)
